GraphicsMagic
 

Compilation
-----------

We take Delphi XE6 as example to illustrate how to compile the GraphicsMagic code.

NOTE: We use string '%Graphics32%' to represent the location of
      the Graphics32 code on your hard drive. And '%GraphicsMagic%'
      represent the location of GraphicsMagic code.


1. Installing Graphics32

   The Graphics32 libary could be downloaded at:
   https://github.com/graphics32/graphics32

   or check out the Graphics32 SVN repository with TortoiseSVN at: 
   svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/graphics32/code

   Please installing at least Graphics32 1.9.1 Fixed which is 
   at the 'branches' directory on the SVN repository. We choose 
   to install the latest which is in the 'trunk' directory of 
   Graphics32 repository.  

   In Delphi XE6 IDE, choose Tools -> Options, in Options dialog, 
   expanding Environment Options -> Delphi Options, choose Library, 
   adding '%Graphics32%\trunk\Source' to the Library Path. 

   Choose Open menu command and locate at 
   '%Graphics32%\trunk\Source\Packages\XE6', open GR32.groupproj
   project group, compile and install GR32_R, and then compile
   and install GR32_D.

   If everything is OK, the Graphics32 should be installed on 
   your Delphi IDE.

2. Installing third-party libraries

   We should only install the Preview component which is at
   '%GraphicsMagic%\externals\Preview'. Please read the ReadMe.html
   for details about how to install it on Delphi IDE.

   Then, in Options dialog of Delphi IDE, we should include the 
   following paths in the Library Path:

       %GraphicsMagic%\externals\efg2
       %GraphicsMagic%\externals\GIFImage
       %GraphicsMagic%\externals\GR32_PNG
       %GraphicsMagic%\externals\Graphics32_3rd_Party
       %GraphicsMagic%\externals\PegtopCommon
       %GraphicsMagic%\externals\TIFF\Bmp2Tiff
       %GraphicsMagic%\externals\TIFF\Tiff2Bmp

3. Installing GraphicsMagic package

   Adding the following paths to the Libray Path of Delphi IDE:

       %GraphicsMagic%\trunk\GraphicsMagicLib
       %GraphicsMagic%\trunk\GraphicsMagicLib\Channels
       %GraphicsMagic%\trunk\GraphicsMagicLib\Commands
       %GraphicsMagic%\trunk\GraphicsMagicLib\Layers
       %GraphicsMagic%\trunk\GraphicsMagicLib\Paths
       %GraphicsMagic%\trunk\PackageLib
   
   Open GraphicsMagic_RSXE6.dpk, compile and install it to Delphi, first.
   Then compile and install GraphicsMagic_DSGN_RSXE6.dpk. The two dpk files
   are in directory '$GraphicsMagic$\trunk\Packages'.

4. Compiling the GraphicsMagic

   Close all the opened projects and files. Open GraphicsMagic.dpr which 
   is at '%GraphicsMagic%\trunk\Source', then try to compile the project.


For now, if everything went well, the GraphicsMagic should be compiled and
run successfully.    


NOTE
----

In directory '%GraphicsMagic%\externals\Graphics32_3rd_Party', there is a
file named GR32_PolygonsOld.pas which is completely identical to the file
GR32_Polygons.pas in Graphics32 1.9.1 Fixed. We renamed it and included it 
with the project is for backward-compatibility to old Graphics32, because 
all the code of GraphicsMagic for now is completely written with Delphi 7 
and Graphics32 1.9.1 .

There is also a file called GR32_Misc.pas in the directory 
'%GraphicsMagic%\externals\Graphics32_3rd_Party'. This file is written by
Angus Johnson. The original code in this file has referenced to the
GR32_Polygons.pas of Graphics 1.9.1. If we compile GraphicsMagic with new
Graphics32, we would be encountered some troubles, because the code of 
GR32_Polygons.pas in new Graphics32 is completely different than the old one.
So, we changed the reference in GR32_Misc.pas from GR32_Polygons.pas to 
GR32_PolygonsOld.pas for dealing with such a question.
  
We are very happy that with GR32_PolygonsOld.pas and modified GR32_Misc.pas 
been included, we can compile the project with new Graphics32.
