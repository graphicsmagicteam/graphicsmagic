These plug-ins are all specifically designed for GraphicsMagic. Actually, they are all DLL files but with .gmp extension name. You could check out all the source code of these plug-ins in the GMPlugins folder. 

In the GMPluginLoader folder, there is a demo program for demonstrating how to load and run these plug-ins. You could open any of plug-ins with Delphi and press Ctrl+F9 to compile it, and copy the compiled file that with the .gmp extendion name into the Plug-Ins folder which included in the GMPluginLoader folder. And then try to load and run the plug-in in the demo program. This demo program is just going to facilitate the test of plug-ins.

Many thanks to Jens Gruschel (http://www.pegtop.net/) for teaching us how to make plug-ins for an application.

If you could make better plug-ins for GraphicsMagic, please let us know. Thank you very much.

Best regards.
